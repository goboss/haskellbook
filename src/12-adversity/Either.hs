module Either where

-- Exercise 1
-- Try to eventually arrive at a solution that uses foldr, even if
-- earlier versions donâ€™t use foldr.
lefts' :: [Either a b] -> [a]
lefts' =
  let
    step (Right _) acc = acc
    step (Left a) acc  = a : acc
  in
    foldr step []

-- Exercise 2
-- Same as the last one. Use foldr eventually.
rights' :: [Either a b] -> [b]
rights' =
  let
    step (Left _) acc = acc
    step (Right b) acc  = b : acc
  in
    foldr step []

-- Exercise 3

partitionEithers' =
  let
    step (Left a) (as, bs)  = (a:as, bs)
    step (Right b) (as, bs) = (as, b:bs)

    foldr step ([],[])

-- Exercise 4
eitherMaybe' :: (b -> c) -> Either a b -> Maybe c

-- Exercise 5
-- This is a general catamorphism for Either values.

-- Exercise 6
-- Same as before, but use the either' function you just wrote.
